# Registered Item Model

A base RDF and SHACL model for register items, register item classes and register
governance metadata, aligned with ISO 19135:2026 (*Geographic information — Registration
and register governance*). Sub-registers profile this model rather than inventing their own.


A register is a catalogue with systematic governance: a content information model
(what an item looks like) plus management metadata (who governs it, what state it is
in, how it changes). ISO 19135:2026 defines one such register model — separating a
**concept plane** (meaning: concepts and concept versions) from a **content plane**
(representation: register item classes and register items) and adding a governance
layer of roles, statuses, actions and commitments.

This repository publishes that model as a single base [OGC Building
Block](https://ogcincubator.github.io/bblocks-docs/), independent of any one register's
own content schema. Any register — a CSV catalogue, the OGC Definitions Server, a
GitHub-managed vocabulary, or a Building Blocks register itself — maps its own
schema's identifiers, statuses and roles onto this base model via a JSON-LD context,
so that management metadata from otherwise unrelated registers becomes one queryable
graph. A sub-register's rules are expressed as a profile of this base block (null,
additive, or constrained), always validating against it.

Register vs. registry: the **register** is the governed information (items,
identifiers, statuses, roles, processes); the **register system** — often loosely
called the "registry" — is merely the information system it happens to run on. This
model describes the former, independent of the latter.


## Building Blocks

### `ogc.model.registered-item.core-ontology` — Registered Item Model

**Type:** model

A base RDF and SHACL model for register items, register item classes and register governance metadata, based on ISO 19135:2026.

### `ogc.model.registered-item.ml-activity-profile` — ML Activity Profile

**Type:** model

A profile of the Registered Item Model describing machine learning training and inference runs as typed register actions, using the STAC MLM extension's task, framework/accelerator and input/output vocabulary.
